GAME THEORY MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION

Problem: Cost Sharing in Cooperative Game (Shapley Value)

Verbal Description:
Three companies {1, 2, 3} want to build a shared facility. Company 1 values it at 60, Company 2 at 70, and Company 3 at 80. Various coalitions can form with different total values: any single company gets its individual value, any pair gets the sum of their values plus a synergy bonus of 20, and all three together get 250.

Mathematical Formulation:

Players: N = {1, 2, 3}

Individual Valuations:
v₁ = 60, v₂ = 70, v₃ = 80

Characteristic Function v(S) for coalition S ⊆ N:
v(∅) = 0
v({1}) = 60
v({2}) = 70  
v({3}) = 80
v({1,2}) = 60 + 70 + 20 = 150
v({1,3}) = 60 + 80 + 20 = 160
v({2,3}) = 70 + 80 + 20 = 170
v({1,2,3}) = 250

Shapley Value Formula:
φᵢ(v) = ∑_{S⊆N\{i}} [|S|!(n-|S|-1)!/n!] × [v(S∪{i}) - v(S)]

Alternative formulation:
φᵢ(v) = (1/n!) ∑_{π∈Π(N)} [v(Pᵢ^π ∪ {i}) - v(Pᵢ^π)]

where Π(N) is the set of all permutations of N, and Pᵢ^π is the set of players preceding i in permutation π.

Shapley Value Calculations:

For Player 1:
φ₁ = (1/6)[v({1}) - v(∅)] + (1/6)[v({1,2}) - v({2})] + (1/6)[v({1,3}) - v({3})] + (1/6)[v({1,2,3}) - v({2,3})] + (1/6)[v({1,2,3}) - v({2,3})] + (1/6)[v({1,2,3}) - v({2,3})]

Simplifying:
φ₁ = (1/6) × 60 + (1/6) × 80 + (1/6) × 80 + (1/3) × 80
φ₁ = 10 + 13.33 + 13.33 + 26.67 = 70

For Player 2:
φ₂ = (1/6) × 70 + (1/6) × 80 + (1/6) × 100 + (1/3) × 80 = 80

For Player 3:
φ₃ = (1/6) × 80 + (1/6) × 90 + (1/6) × 90 + (1/3) × 80 = 100

Verification:
φ₁ + φ₂ + φ₃ = 70 + 80 + 100 = 250 = v(N) ✓

Shapley Axioms Satisfied:
1. Efficiency: ∑ᵢ∈N φᵢ(v) = v(N)
2. Symmetry: If i and j are symmetric, then φᵢ(v) = φⱼ(v)
3. Dummy: If i is dummy, then φᵢ(v) = 0
4. Additivity: φᵢ(v + w) = φᵢ(v) + φᵢ(w)

Core Analysis:
A payoff vector (x₁, x₂, x₃) is in the core if:
- x₁ + x₂ + x₃ = 250 (efficiency)
- xᵢ ≥ v({i}) for all i (individual rationality)
- xᵢ + xⱼ ≥ v({i,j}) for all pairs {i,j} (coalition rationality)

Mathematical Properties:
- Transferable utility game
- Superadditive: v(S∪T) ≥ v(S) + v(T) for disjoint S,T
- Convex game: marginal contributions increase
- Non-empty core (due to convexity)

Game Type: Cooperative game with transferable utility
Solution Concepts: Shapley Value, Core, Marginal Contribution
