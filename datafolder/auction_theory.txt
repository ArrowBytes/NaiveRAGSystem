GAME THEORY MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION

Problem: First-Price Sealed-Bid Auction

Verbal Description:
There are n bidders competing for a single object. Each bidder i has a private valuation vᵢ drawn from a uniform distribution on [0,1]. Bidders simultaneously submit sealed bids. The highest bidder wins and pays their bid.

Mathematical Formulation:

Players: N = {1, 2, ..., n}

Private Information: 
vᵢ ~ U[0,1] independently for each i ∈ N

Strategy Space: 
Bᵢ: [0,1] → ℝ₊ (bid function mapping valuations to bids)

Allocation Rule:
Winner: i* = arg max{b₁, b₂, ..., bₙ} (highest bidder wins)
Payment: pᵢ* = bᵢ* (winner pays their bid)

Payoff Functions:
For winner i*: uᵢ*(vᵢ*, bᵢ*) = vᵢ* - bᵢ*
For losers j ≠ i*: uⱼ(vⱼ, bⱼ) = 0

Bayesian Nash Equilibrium:

Symmetric Equilibrium Bid Function:
bᵢ*(vᵢ) = ((n-1)/n) × vᵢ

Derivation:
Let all other players follow strategy b*(v) = αv
Player i's probability of winning: P(win|vᵢ, bᵢ) = P(vⱼ < bᵢ/α for all j ≠ i)
= (bᵢ/α)^(n-1) if bᵢ/α ≤ 1

Expected utility: E[uᵢ|vᵢ, bᵢ] = (vᵢ - bᵢ) × (bᵢ/α)^(n-1)

First-order condition: ∂E[uᵢ]/∂bᵢ = 0
-(bᵢ/α)^(n-1) + (vᵢ - bᵢ) × (n-1) × (bᵢ/α)^(n-2) × (1/α) = 0

Solving: bᵢ = ((n-1)/n) × vᵢ
Therefore: α = (n-1)/n

Equilibrium Properties:
- Probability of winning: P(win|vᵢ) = vᵢ^(n-1)
- Expected utility: E[uᵢ|vᵢ] = vᵢ^n/n
- Expected payment by winner: E[payment|win] = (n-1)/(n+1)
- Expected revenue: E[Revenue] = (n-1)/(n+1)

Revenue Equivalence:
Expected revenue = E[max{v₁, v₂, ..., vₙ}] = n/(n+1)

Mathematical Properties:
- Bayesian game with incomplete information
- Private values model
- Symmetric information structure
- Risk neutral bidders

Game Type: Bayesian game with incomplete information
Solution Concepts: Bayesian Nash Equilibrium, Revenue Equivalence, Optimal Bidding Strategy
