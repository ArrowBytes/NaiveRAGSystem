GAME THEORY MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION

Problem: Coordination Game

Verbal Description:
Two friends want to meet but forgot to decide on a location. Each can go to either the Park or the Mall. They both prefer meeting at the Park (utility 3 each) over the Mall (utility 1 each), but getting no reward (utility 0) if they go to different places.

Mathematical Formulation:

Players: N = {1, 2}

Strategy Sets: 
S₁ = S₂ = {Park, Mall}

Payoff Matrix (Player 1, Player 2):
                Player 2
               Park  Mall
Player 1  Park [3,3] [0,0]
          Mall [0,0] [1,1]

Utility Functions:
u₁(Park, Park) = 3, u₁(Park, Mall) = 0, u₁(Mall, Park) = 0, u₁(Mall, Mall) = 1
u₂(Park, Park) = 3, u₂(Park, Mall) = 0, u₂(Mall, Park) = 0, u₂(Mall, Mall) = 1

Nash Equilibrium Analysis:

Pure Strategy Nash Equilibria:
1. (Park, Park) with payoffs (3, 3) - Pareto efficient
2. (Mall, Mall) with payoffs (1, 1) - Pareto inferior

Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium:
Let p be the probability each player chooses Park.

Indifference condition for Player 1:
3p + 0(1-p) = 0p + 1(1-p)
3p = 1-p
4p = 1
p = 1/4

Expected utility in mixed strategy equilibrium:
EU₁ = EU₂ = (1/4) × 3 + (3/4) × 0 × (1/4) + (1/4) × 0 × (3/4) + (3/4) × 1 × (3/4)
EU₁ = EU₂ = 3/4

Best Response Functions:
BR₁(p₂) = {Park if p₂ > 1/4, Mall if p₂ < 1/4, any mixed strategy if p₂ = 1/4}
BR₂(p₁) = {Park if p₁ > 1/4, Mall if p₁ < 1/4, any mixed strategy if p₁ = 1/4}

Mathematical Properties:
- Symmetric game: u₁(s₁,s₂) = u₂(s₂,s₁)
- Coordination problem: Multiple equilibria
- Payoff dominance: (Park, Park) Pareto dominates (Mall, Mall)
- Risk dominance: (Mall, Mall) is risk dominant over (Park, Park)

Game Type: Coordination game with multiple equilibria
Solution Concepts: Multiple Nash Equilibria, Coordination Problem, Mixed Strategy Equilibrium
