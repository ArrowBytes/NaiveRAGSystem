GAME THEORY MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION

Problem: Two-Player Zero-Sum Game

Verbal Description:
Two players compete where one player's gain equals the other's loss. Player A can choose from strategies {High, Low} and Player B can choose from strategies {Left, Right}. The payoff matrix shows Player A's gains (Player B's losses).

Mathematical Formulation:

Players: N = {A, B}

Strategy Sets: 
S_A = {High, Low}
S_B = {Left, Right}

Payoff Matrix (Player A's payoffs, Player B gets negative):
              Player B
             Left  Right
Player A  H   [3]   [-1]
          L   [-2]   [4]

Matrix Representation: A = [[3, -1], [-2, 4]]

Zero-Sum Property: u_A(s) + u_B(s) = 0 for all strategy profiles s

Minimax Solution:
Value of the game: V = max_i min_j A_ij = min_j max_i A_ij

Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium:
Let p = (p_H, p_L) be Player A's mixed strategy
Let q = (q_L, q_R) be Player B's mixed strategy

Player A's expected payoff: E[u_A] = p^T A q

Equilibrium conditions:
Player A indifferent: 3q_L - q_R = -2q_L + 4q_R
Player B indifferent: 3p_H - 2p_L = -p_H + 4p_L

Solving the system:
p_H = 6/10 = 0.6, p_L = 4/10 = 0.4
q_L = 5/10 = 0.5, q_R = 5/10 = 0.5

Game Value: V = 1.2

Linear Programming Formulation:
max v subject to:
∑_i p_i A_ij ≥ v for all j
∑_i p_i = 1
p_i ≥ 0

Mathematical Properties:
- Zero-sum: ∑ᵢ uᵢ(s) = 0
- Constant-sum game
- Minimax theorem applies
- Unique value exists

Game Type: Two-player zero-sum simultaneous game
Solution Concepts: Minimax Theorem, Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium, Value of Game
