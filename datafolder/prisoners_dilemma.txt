GAME THEORY MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION

Problem: Classic Prisoner's Dilemma

Verbal Description:
Two suspects are arrested and held in separate cells. Each can either confess (defect) or remain silent (cooperate). If both cooperate, they each get 1 year in prison. If both defect, they each get 3 years. If one cooperates and one defects, the cooperator gets 5 years and the defector goes free.

Mathematical Formulation:

Players: N = {1, 2}

Strategy Sets: 
S₁ = S₂ = {Cooperate, Defect}

Payoff Matrix for Player 1 (Player 2 payoffs symmetric):
                Player 2
               C    D
Player 1  C  [-1]  [-5]
          D  [0]   [-3]

Utility Functions:
u₁(C,C) = -1, u₁(C,D) = -5, u₁(D,C) = 0, u₁(D,D) = -3
u₂(C,C) = -1, u₂(C,D) = 0, u₂(D,C) = -5, u₂(D,D) = -3

Game Analysis:
Nash Equilibrium: (Defect, Defect) with payoffs (-3, -3)
Pareto Optimal: (Cooperate, Cooperate) with payoffs (-1, -1)
Dominant Strategy: Defection is strictly dominant for both players

Mathematical Properties:
- Non-zero-sum game: ∑ᵢ uᵢ(s) ≠ constant
- Symmetric game: Player roles are interchangeable
- Social dilemma: Individual rationality leads to collective irrationality

Game Type: Two-player non-zero-sum simultaneous game
Solution Concepts: Nash Equilibrium, Pareto Optimality, Dominant Strategy
